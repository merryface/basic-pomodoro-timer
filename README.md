#  Pomodoro Timer

Basic Swift project to ease into Xcode and Swift. <br>
Timer starts with 25 minutes on the clock. Background changes to red, and the time counts down. When the 25 minutes run out, the time automatically resets to 5 minutes and the background changes to green, indicating the brake time. At the end of the 5 minutes, the cycle repeats. <br>
The timer can be paused or reset.
